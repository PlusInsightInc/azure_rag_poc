Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Embeddings model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
- Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
- Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

Azure AI Search (formerly known as Azure Cognitive Search) is the only cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to easily identify and explore relevant content at scale. It uses the same integrated Microsoft logic that powers Bing and Microsoft 365.
